Error during installation
-------------------------

Stamp Info needs to install Pillow, an external Python imagery library, in order to work correctly. For various
reasons this installation may not run correctly, it is then important to check and follow the installation steps.

When the installation is not successfull the standard Preferences panel of Stamp Info is switched to another one
that will report the error and provide the steps to fix the issue.

Here is how the panel will look like:
